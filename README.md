Pig Latin Converter:
This program takes a first name (like "Michael", "Nancy", or "Ophelia") and a number input. If the number input is 0, the program prints the name unchanged. If the input is 1 then the name is converted to pig latin. For example, Michael becomes ichaelmay and Nancy becomes ancynay.
