# Upper Case and Title Converter
This program takes a first name (like "Michael", "Nancy", or "Ophelia") and a number input. If the number input is 0, the program prints the name unchanged. If the input is 1 then the name is centered and the first letter is capitalized.

# Installation
The code is inside the Jupyter notebook Code.ipynb. Your computer must have installed Python (which you can download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and JupyterLab (installation instructions found [here](https://jupyter.org/install)). Afer cloning the repository, open Code.ipynb using JupyterLab to view the code. 

# Usage
Run the cell containing code by clicking the first cell, then clicking "run the selected cells" in the Jupyter notebook. 
**Inputs:** Input 1 should be your first name - any string will be accepted as an input. Input 2 should be a 0 to return your name as is, or a 1 to return your name correctly capitalized as a title. No other input is accepted - if any input other than 0 or 1 is submitted no output will be shown.
**Outputs:** The output will be your name (as written or capitalized) centered among periods. If the entered first name is already capitalized or begins with a character not in the alphabet (such as a number or punctuation) then a second input of both 0 will return that same string while a 1 will return that same string centered among periods.

**A note on the Code of Conduct:** This is a copied code of conduct I found that is used very commonly (Google, Linux), and seems to cover all the talking points I was going to cover. This one explains the concepts much more eloquently than I ever could.

**A note on the License:** This is an adopted license from another website, I went over a condensed list and it would allow Commercial use Distribution, Modification, Patent use, and Private use. The conditions to use our code would require the users to: Disclose source, License and copyright notice, and State the changes they made. Also users who use the network would be allowed a copy of the source code and it would require them to release their modifications under the same license as the original.
